The borrowing_records table contains user-borrowed books. The user and book table have many to many relationship and by mapping userId from the user table and bookId from the book table the borrowing_records table is generated. A user is able to register to the system by using a username and email. After registering, the user can see all the books in the system and available books to borrow in the system. Also, able to filter the books using author and published year.

Using the system can borrow books. When borrowing a book, a new record is added to the borrowing_record table. When borrowing a book userId and bookId pass from the front end. Then check whether a copy of the book is available to borrow. When borrowing successfully reduce the copies of the book by 1. Until a borrowed book is returned the returnDate column is null in the borrowing_record table. At the time of returning the book update the returnDate column. 
Added a basic authentication to all APIs of the borrowing_record controller and book controller. But a user can get all the books in the system without authentication. 
To make the solution optimal added indexes to tables.
